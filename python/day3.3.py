# Example program to input two numbers and print their sum:
#program to find the average of two numbers instead of the sum.

number1 = int(input("enter the number 1 :") )
number2 = int(input("enter the number 2 :")) 
sum = number1 + number2
avarage = sum/2
print (" the sum of two number = " , sum)
print (" the avarage of two number = " ,  avarage)
